0- Write a program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line.
	-The program should return 0

1- Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
	-Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);
	-You can only use _putchar twice in your code

2- Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
	-Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void);
	-You can only use _putchar twice in your code

3- Write a function that checks for lowercase character.
	-Prototype: int _islower(int c);
	-Returns 1 if c is lowercase
	-Returns 0 otherwise
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: islower. Run man islower to learn more.

4- Write a function that checks for alphabetic character.
	-Prototype: int _isalpha(int c);
	-Returns 1 if c is a letter, lowercase or uppercase
	-Returns 0 otherwise
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: isalpha. Run man isalpha to learn more.

5- Write a function that prints the sign of a number.
	-Prototype: int print_sign(int n);
	-Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero
	-Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero
	-Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero

6- Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
	-Prototype: int _abs(int);
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: abs. Run man abs to learn more.
