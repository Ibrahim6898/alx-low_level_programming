0 - Write a function that fills memory with a constant byte.
	Prototype: char *_memset(char *s, char b, unsigned int n);
	The _memset() function fills the first n bytes of the memory 		area pointed to by s with the constant byte b
	Returns a pointer to the memory area s

1 - Write a function that copies memory area.
	Prototype: char *_memcpy(char *dest, char *src, unsigned 		int n);
	The _memcpy() function copies n bytes from memory area src to		 memory area dest
	Returns a pointer to dest

2 - Write a function that locates a character in a string.
	Prototype: char *_strchr(char *s, char c);
	Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c 		in the string s, or NULL if the character is not found
	FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strch.		Run man strchr to learn more.
